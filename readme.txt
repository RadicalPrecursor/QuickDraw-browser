To-Do list:
    Interface things:
        Slightly more front-end polish (like, only a little)
        Erase function - whole thing
        Undo function - last action

    More game functionality:
        Card prompts
        Count-down
        Include halogens

    The hard stuff:
        I can generate an array of the connectivity but how do I get that to the logic parts I've written?

    Almost certainly need to ask for help on:
        1) Why do I have to do such a weird janky thing to get my structure list to map correctly from my bonds?
        2) How best to handle the situation with my drawing box and coordinates?
