To-Do list:
    Interface things:
        Better front-end polish
            do a CSS cleanup + upgraded layout
                currently the layout is essentially carefully-arranged popsicle sticks held up by static friction and prayer
            This is probably going to have to tie into my coordinate situation though.
        Erase function - whole thing
        Undo function - last action

    More game functionality:
        Card prompts
            can draw full deck
            scoring/partial redraw functionality next
        Count-down
        Include halogens

    The hard stuff:
        I can generate an array of the connectivity but how do I get that to the logic parts I've written?

    Almost certainly need to ask for help on:
        1) Why do I have to do such a weird janky thing to get my structure list to map correctly from my bonds?
            1.1) AAAAAHHHGGGHHHH why do I have to click twice to update state wtf?
        2) How best to handle the situation with my drawing box and coordinates?

    Other tangents:
        Write up a guide on how to handle drawing and coordinates
            Go through systematically....that could actually be super super cool
